# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Overview of Project
#### By studying a wide range of Kickstarter campaigns we've been able to analyze trends related to: fundraising goals; campaign starting dates and duration; and finally, the outcomes of campaigns similar to that of Louise's play, "Fever".  

### Purpose
#### The purpose of this is to understand how Louise might have positioned her fundraising campaign for a greater level of success.


## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
#### Two conclusions drawn by comparing fundraising campaign outcomes with launch date:
1.  Theater campaigns initiated in the months of May and June are considerably more successful than those campaigns initiated in other months.
2.  December campaings resulted in the fewest successes.  Perhaps due to potential contributors adjusting their spending for the holiday season, this month had the fewest successful campaigns of the years in the analysis.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
#### Below you can see an analysis of fundraising campaign outcomes based on the fundraising goals that were set.
#### By creating a table and a CountIf function to sum the results of each campaign in the "play" subcategory according to the set goal ranges we can see that:
#### 1. The percentage of successful campaigns steadily decreases from 76% for campaigns with goals less than $1,000 to 20% for campaigns with goals in the $25,000 to$29,999 range.  This goal range represents a total of over 1000 campaigns.
#### 2. The percentage of successful campaigns with goals of $30,000 and higher increases for a very few number of plays and then falls off significantly.  These might be seen as outliers due to extenuating circumstances and further investigation into those successful campaigns might be appropriate.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
